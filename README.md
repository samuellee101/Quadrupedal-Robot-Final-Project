# Quadrupedal Robot with the aim of Obstacle Avoidance using Artificial Intelligence
UTRGV - University of Texas Rio Grande Valley

Hello, my name is Samuel Lee, and together with my fellow teammmates Ryunghoon Ahn, and Christopher Valdes, we aimed to have a quadrupedal robot walking by the end of our senior design project.

The quadrupedal robot was built using a combination of 3D printed parts using UTRGV's engineering building print labs, servos/wires/Jetson Nano purchased online, and was constructed in the Artificial Intelligence lab at UTRGV.

Ryunghoon Ahn was responsible for the physical construction of the robot. This includes soldering/screwing parts and ordering electrical parts online.

The file 'gazebo/spot_mini_mini' has work that Christopher and Ryunghoon did in order to make the robot run in simulations.

The file 'gyroscope' details work that Samuel did in order to get the gyroscope up and running.

The file 'midterm-presentation' shows what we presented during our midterm presentations, and the powerpoint within details our progress halfway through this project. joint Christopher/Samuel effort.

The file '3D-printed-instructions' details work that Samuel did in order to get the 3D printed parts necessary for the project.

As of May 1, 2023, more files are to come, as we wrap up this project and present our final presentation on May 10, 2023. Our final presentation, and more documentation will be added, however our primary focus is the simulation, which Ryunghoon and Christopher are in charge of.

The robot itself is able to move its legs with the help of the servo. Video/Images will be included in the final presentation.

Thank you for taking the time to read this.
